## About The Project

Welcome to the Connect Four game project, a fun and exciting endeavor that challenges you to create a fully functional two-player game using JavaFX GUI. In this game, players take turns dropping checkers into a slot on a 7x6 game board, with the ultimate goal of getting four checkers in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The game board is represented by a GridPane, a JavaFX layout container that arranges nodes in a grid-like pattern. The checkers are represented by GameButton instances, which extend the Button class. Players make moves by clicking on a GameButton on the GridPane, which then updates the game board and displays the checkers accordingly.

The game's GUI includes a welcome screen and a gameplay screen. The welcome screen displays a brief description of the game and a "Start Game" button, which takes the player to the gameplay screen. The gameplay screen consists of a menu bar, a game board, an area displaying whose turn it is, and a history of moves made.

The menu bar has three menus: Game Play, Themes, and Options. The Game Play menu provides options for the players to control the game. For instance, there is a "reverse move" option to undo the last move, and players can also choose to start a new game or exit the game. The Themes menu provides the player with the option to choose from three different themes, such as Star Wars, Dragon Ball Z, and Rick & Morty. The Options menu provides additional settings for how to play, initiate a new game session, and exit the application.

The implementation of this game shows a comprehensive understanding of JavaFX, event handling, and game logic. Additionally, proper error handling, input validation, and edge cases are considered in the implementation to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.
